Working with a team of four we designed and built a functional web app resembling Yelp for the students on the University of Hawaii Manoa campus to find their specific food item nearby. Students can search for their food and get a page of restaurants around Manoa with that item.

To build Foodie Cravings we used the React, Meteor, Mongo DB stack. We managed our work flow using Github issue driven project management. Our team met twice a week and worked remotely our our own issues. 

As of 4-20-19 Foodie Cravings is still a work in progress. It will be brought to completion by the end of the spring 19' semester.

A summary of our web app, along with installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/foodiecravings/foodiecravings.github.io/blob/master/index.md).

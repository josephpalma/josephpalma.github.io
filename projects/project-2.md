This project is still on-going. When it is finished it will be a cloud system designed to take the storage load off any hard drive. Using the repositories on the Google Cloud Platform, that way you only pay for what you use. Specifically you pay for each file transfer. 
The drive is found locally as a external media server. It utilizes the Seafile open souce server project, the cloud is deployed to the Seafile server using Docker. 
This project developed as a way to easily store and access large amounts of music. Eventually I want to develop cloud enabled thumb drives that hold no memory but are connected to the internet and act as a bridge between a computer and the cloud.

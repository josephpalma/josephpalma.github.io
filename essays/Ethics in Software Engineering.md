## Discrepencies in Engineering Ethics

Ethical and moral quandaries are more common in software engineering compared to other fields in the discipline, yet they are still ill-defined socially and legally. The discrepancy is due to late development of the field itself, from the inception of the first programmable computer by German Konrad Zuse in 1936 to 2018 we saw no real standards of ethics in computing. The electrical, mechanical and civil disciplines of engineering saw no universal adaptation of ethical codes until the American Engineering Society assumed a form of them in 1914. No date can be put on the inception of general engineering, but it is safe to say that decades, even centuries passed without any formal definition of ethical codes. Almost a century later, we have concrete guidelines to remaining ethically conscious in the field of software engineering thanks to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), which developed their [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics), officially adopting it in 2018. 

These general rules were difficult to define because there was no context for them until their ethical implications took effect. Unfortunately, it is too late to prevent any negative consequences after an event, and the only solution is to create a legal resolution to protect individuals in the future. To investigate further I will consider the case of Facebook, their CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the ethical dilemmas they’ve faced trying to enforce fairness and free speech among social media users amidst attacks from political foreign agents, trolls, hackers and fake news. 

## The Case of Facebook

The year was 2017, and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign allied with some unusual actors. Russian agents infiltrated Facebook with the goal of getting Trump elected by spreading misinformation about his opponent. The concern was spotted early on and brought to the attention of Security Chief Alex Stamos, however he failed to act and actively concealed the situation from his superiors. The social media behemoths business model primarily focuses on growth, and the ad revenue and increased user numbers looked good to Stamos despite their ethical implications. 

This information came to the surprise of Zuckerberg and associates who had to answer to questions from almost everyone, including Congress. Much of the confusion within Facebook came from their lack of company standard ethical definitions. Concerning the misinformation, colloquially termed ‘fake news’, their will to remain true to the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution led them to ignore much of the hate speech and fake news campaigns which were gaining serious traction on their network. A simple standard policy on disinformation would eliminate the ethical dilemmas faced by Stamos, Zuckerberg, the politicians involved. The political battles the tech company quickly became entrenched in could have been easily avoided with a standard ethical policy to guide them. Since then, Facebook has adopted their own ethical code, yet the implications have yet to be described in any bills as they are to complex and broad to enforce in law. 


Facebook is just one example of a social disaster that could have been avoided if there were codes in place to protect them and the consumers. If all organizations that benefit from their technological advances adopted the ACM Code of Ethics society could avoid many of these social ‘bridge collapses’.

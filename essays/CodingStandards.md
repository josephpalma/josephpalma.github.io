### Coding Standards

Coding standards are a defined set of programming guidelines & best practices that developers are required to adhere to when writing code. They are applied to companies aiming to achieve standard conventions in their code. My experience with coding standards has been minimal, by applying the CS departments rules over the last two semesters I have established a standardized foundation.

### Effective Standards 

The code style I have worked in thus far has been very effective for learning coding concepts. When learning Java in Eclipse, we applied Checkstyle, an automated coding standard checker. Some examples of some conventions I found most successful for learning: 
  - All block closing brackets need to go on a separate line
  - All methods and classes must be separated by one line
  - No more than one statement per line
  - No more than 120 characters per line
  
Recently I've been adapting to JavaScript using IntelliJ with a different, looser standard of code. This standard is more flexible, and grants a margin of creativity. The process of transitioning to a new standard has left me with a lot to examine. For instance: what makes good standards? I value, short and concise general rules of formatting. The rules are enforceable and non-ambiguous, they are black and white *standards* not *opinions*. That being said standards for a group should be designed by a veteran in the subject, who has the most experience with it's tools and goals. When designed and implemented in the right way, good standards will make wrong code look wrong.

### Ineffective Standards

As a student my perspective on coding standards is pretty watered down, but as I look into the future I can see how attitudes can become sour. Coding standards are only effective when they are enforceable, and enforcing them hinders personal expression. It gives room to critique someones creation based on preference, not performance. Well implemented standards are a tool, but like any tool they can be abused. When collaborating with multiple people on a project you naturally get at least one 'control freak'. In the future I foresee coding standards becoming a tool of control in a corporate environment. The development community is already littered with big egos that are convinced their way is the only acceptable standard; imagining individuals with that perspective on coding holding the reins of enforcement within a company is discouraging. 

Applying effective coding standards is important and probably one of the most vital factors to success in a language or project. Letting your personal, informal style go you can adapt to a groups standards for maximum progress.

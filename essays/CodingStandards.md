### Coding Standards

Coding standards are a defined set of guidlines and best practices in programming that developers are required to adhere to when writing code for a project. They are applied to companies to achieve standard conventions in their code. My expierence with coding standards has been minimal, by applying the CS departments standards over the last two semesters I have established a collaborative foundation that I will now explore.

### Effective Standards 

The code style I have worked in thus far has been very effective for learning coding concepts. When learning Java in Eclipse, we applied Checkstyle, an automated coding standard checker. Some examples of some conventions I found most successful for learning: 
-All block closing brackets need to go on a seperate line
-All methods and classes must be seperated by one line
-No more than one statement per line
-No more than 120 characters per line
Recently I've been adapting to Javascript using IntelliJ with a different, looser stanard of code. This standard is more flexible, and grants a margin of creativety. The process of transitioning to a new standard has left me with a lot to examine. For instance: what makes good standards? I value, short and concise general rules of formatting. The rules are enforable and non-ambiguous, they are black and white *standards* not *opinions*. That being said standards for a group should be designed by a vetern in the subject, who has the most expierence with it's tools and goals. When designed and implemented in the right way, good standards will make bad code look wrong.

### Ineffective Standards

As a student my prespective on coding standards is pretty watered down, but as I look into the future I can see how attitudes can become sour. Coding standards are only effective when they are enforcable, and enforcing them hinders personal expression. It gives room to critique someones creation based on preference, not performance. Well implemented standards are a tool, but like any tool they can be abused. When collaborating with mulitple people on a project you naturally get at least one 'control freak'. In the future I forsee coding standards becoming a tool of control in a corporate enviroment. The development community is already littered with big egos that are convinced their way is the only acceptable standard; imagining individuals with that prespective on coding holding the reins of enforcment within a company is discouraging.

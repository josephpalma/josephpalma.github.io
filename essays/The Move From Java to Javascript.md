##The Move From Java to Javascript
##By Joe Palma
###Javascript is Pretty Cool
<img class="ui small left floated rounded image" scr=".../images/javascript-36f5949a45.png" I recently started practicing Javascript in my software engineering class. It was pretty much intuitive to pick up, it felt like it could require zero background expierence in programming. After working with a handful of scripting languages, javascript is one of the most functional. Javascript has a slightly different structure from its parent language; Java. Objects, for instance, are handeled very differently in Javascript. Javascript is more or less class-less. This allows objects to be more dynamic, for they dont get tied down with the constraints of classical hierarchys. Power comes with a strong hierarchy, but with Javascript objects you can be fast and effective without sacrificing raw computing power.

###Javascript Integration
Java script goes hand in hand with Html and CSS. Together these languages form a spear of web development. Theyy are easy to practice because you dont need an IDE program to use them. Sites like JS Fiddle and JS Bin offer browser-based independant development enviroments. 


###Success in Programming
In my class, I feel like a cadet in boot camp. The exercises are designed to maximize return by employing a stress enducing approach to programming. The "work-out of the day" routine requires you to perfect a coding skill, for a grade. Falling behind in the course left me with 106 Javascript excersises to do in one day. Programming is a high level skill with many peices to master, so it only makes sense to take a fast paced approach to it. Learning a few things a day would never be enough to say, build an app, in a reasonable amount of time. That is why I think the athletic pedagogy is effective in becoming fluent in the craft. Applying yourself everyday, keeping on track with skill progression, and ... not turning 21 during the semester ... are good ways of succeeding in programming, in school and life in general.

###My Goals
Going forward I want to expand my mind in the realm of Java, taking full advantage of the mass of reasources provided by my class. I want to become more effective with my time, soaking up large amounts of information in a timely manner. I want to take the athletic approach to all things in life, because crossing things off your to-do list is better than sex. I feel the key to becoming a good group worker is knowing how to use your time effectively. So is my goal for the class, through the vessel of programming I will become an effective user of my valuable time.

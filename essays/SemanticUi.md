### The Browser Is Your Canvas

The UI framework is a creative medium for technical minds. It's architecture is bounded to the design of the Html language. It's tag-ular components allow for nearly full functionality inside any Html document. Of course the incorporation of CSS extends the application of style. The cascading sheets are intuitive additions to any design. The script component allows you to link any script to an Html document.

Semantic UI is a wonderful application of the framework, it allows for easily understandable code. The semantics of the tag describe it accurately, hence the name. It is superior to a framework which rely more on the traditional code style of class hierarchy. For example an 'a' tag using a framework like Twitter Bootstrap may look something like:

	<a class="ui-grid ui-grid-stackable ui-grid-equal-height ui-grid-inverted ui-grid-stackable"></a>

When in Semantic UI it would be:

	<a class="ui stackable inverted divided equal height stackable grid"></a>

Which is easier to read? 

That being said, UI is a wonderful tool for the creative programmer. It's effective, powerful, rewarding and always in high demand, arguably more so than back-end developers. From a 'back-end developer' perspective UI is a rather small library. It's concepts and design however require climbing over a rather steep learning curve. Once you become familiar with the attributes, elements, collections and modules you'll be cranking out beautiful pages in a short amount of time. 

Web design is a field that has been evolving since the dawn of the Internet. The standard aesthetic increases everyday, and with the advent of Semantic UI that standard jumped 5 notches.
